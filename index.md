# Jacob R. Swette  
Graduate Epidemiology Student Researcher | Biomimicry-based Problem Solver | Chinese Medicine Clinician  

Welcome — I study how daily and seasonal behavioral rhythms, sleep adequacy, and ecological conditions shape human health. My current work focuses on modifying pathways between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and chronic or recurrent pediatric pain using the National Survey of Children’s Health (2022–2023).

## About Me
I am an MPH–Epidemiology student at the University of South Florida and a researcher with the Lawton & Rhea Chiles Center for Healthy Mothers and Babies. I also hold an MS in Biomimicry from Arizona State University, where I completed comparative oncology work at the Arizona Cancer Evolution Center. I also have an extensive background in Chinese ethnomedicine which shapes many of my research questions.

My broader interests include epidemiology, disease ecology, One Health, and planetary-health frameworks.

## Research & Projects
- **ACE × Sleep × Pain Study (NSCH 2022–2023)**  
  Evaluating whether sleep modifies ACE–pain associations in U.S. children using survey-weighted logistic regression and interaction modeling.

- **Cancer Resistance in Elephants: A Multi-Species Analysis of Neoplasia Prevalence**  
  Analyzed 2,687 elephant necropsy and tumor-report records from multiple datasets to estimate species-specific neoplasia and malignancy prevalence and assess demographic and
  reproductive-tract patterns.

- **Biomimicry for Malaria Vector Control**  
  Explored ecological strategies to improve malaria vector-control chemistry.
